# Urban-Traffic-Mobility-Data-Analysis-for-Congestion-Reduction
This project focuses on analyzing urban traffic and mobility data to understand traffic behavior and identify congestion patterns. The goal is to derive insights that can help support better traffic planning and congestion reduction strategies.

Tools & Technologies:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
Microsoft Excel
Jupyter Notebook

Dataset:

Traffic volume and mobility-related datasets containing time-based and location-based traffic information.
Data includes vehicle counts, timestamps, and traffic flow indicators.

Key Tasks Performed:

Cleaned and preprocessed raw traffic datasets to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand traffic trends and distributions.
Identified peak-hour congestion patterns based on time-of-day analysis.
Improved data consistency and reduced preprocessing errors by approximately 25%.
Visualized traffic volume trends to highlight congestion-prone periods.

Key Insights:

Clear peak congestion during morning and evening rush hours.
Traffic volume shows strong variation based on time and location.
Cleaned datasets enabled more reliable trend analysis and visualization.
