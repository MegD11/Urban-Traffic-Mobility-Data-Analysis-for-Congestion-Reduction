# Urban-Traffic-Mobility-Data-Analysis-for-Congestion-Reduction
This project analyzes urban traffic and mobility data collected from vehicle movement sensors to understand traffic behavior and identify congestion patterns. Vehicle speed trends are used as a proxy to study congestion during different time intervals.

Tools & Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Microsoft Excel
- Jupyter Notebook

Dataset:
The dataset contains vehicle mobility data with attributes such as:
- Speed (kmph)
- Time
- Distance traveled
- GPS coordinates
- Acceleration metrics

Tasks Performed:
- Extracted and merged relevant data from multiple sheets.
- Cleaned and standardized speed and time values.
- Analyzed speed variations to identify potential congestion periods.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualized average speed trends over time.
